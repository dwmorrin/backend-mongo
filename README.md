# Using MongoDB

## Goals

- use the same mongoose schemas on both server & client
- use TypeScript on both server & client

## Setup

`npm i`

Using `tsc` to build and `nodemon` to refresh `node` on save.
Use the appropriate npm script to run the project.

(Currently using `npm run watch` for normal dev use.)

Developed in VS Code.
